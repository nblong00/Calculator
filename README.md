# Calculator

To use code, create new project in VS and use C# Console App (.NET Framework). Paste code from Program.cs (Github version) into your Program.cs file within VS. Should run without issues.

This calculator can currently perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has fault tolerence built into it such as when a user does not want to specify either a, s, m, or d. I plan to expand fault tolerance in the future.
